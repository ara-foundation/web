## Documentation

### Architecture
Let's first explain the components that made up the Ara Web.

The background is the same for all pages.
All pages have the same classic web layout: `Header`, `Content`, `Footer`.
Each layout also composed of three sections: `Left`, `Center`, `Right`.

Below is the mockup with the rectangles defining layouts and sections. Red rectangles define the layouts. Yellow rectangles define the sections.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Customization

- Add your own avatar in the `public/` directory
- Edit `src/config.ts` to use your website, name, and description
- Edit pages in `src/pages/`
- Modify the layout in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- Update styles in the respective component files
- Make your own favicons with https://realfavicongenerator.net/

## Colors

The colors were chosen using several tools to insure accessibility and contrast. The colors are all set using variables for dark and light in the global.css file. Personally, I created the palletes and gradients using these tools:

- https://www.learnui.design/tools/accessible-color-generator.html
- https://colorffy.com/mesh-gradient-generator (for the background gradient)
